# Shine in the Darkness

> “When we say *it was nice seeing you*, we mean it.”

For many people who are blind or low vision, seeing is not a casual phrase.
It is a moment — rare, meaningful, and deeply human.

Shine in the Darkness exists to create more of those moments.

This is an accessibility-first, trade-forward nonprofit platform supporting blind and low-vision communities through dignified fundraising, elegant design, and transparent systems. We begin with something small and invite the world to trade it forward — not through pressure or pity, but through meaning and participation.

Luxury here is not excess.
It is intention, craftsmanship, and respect.

Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **TailwindCSS**, and **Stripe**.

## Why This Exists

Many fundraisers rely on pity or spectacle.
This project does not.

Shine in the Darkness is built from lived experience and structured like a system:
small inputs, compounding generosity, and clear outcomes.

Luxury here is not excess.
It is intention, craftsmanship, and dignity.ripe.

## Core Principles

- Accessibility is the foundation, not a feature
- No pity framing, no dark patterns
- Transparency in donations and outcomes
- Luxury without loudness
- Participation over extraction
